Logix is a simple and easy to use Prolog/LISP/etc. text editor with syntax highlighting and many other features.

# Current version
Current version of Logix is **Testfire**. This version aims at having all the basic features done, so Logix can be used as still a basic code editor, albeit a very carefully developed one.![testfire1](https://github.com/fraaaaa4/logix/assets/87281326/a0fe45b0-b595-417d-ae3f-73de637a9c97)


It features the following (but not only) features:
- **Tabbed browsing**
- **Prolog, LISP, ByaccJ, JFlex syntax** with function highlighting, variable highlighting, and Intellisense-like autocomplete menu for system functions
- **Bookmarks**
- **AutoComplete**: automatically add header, footer of the source file, or automatically add comments
- **Document map**
- **Gramlex**: GUI front-end for JFlex and ByaccJ, all integrated into one application. Does everything for you, including mantaining settings between sessions, so it's even faster/easier!

 # Development notes and credits
 This project has been built using Visual Studio 2005, built against .NET Framework 2.0. Credits to Pavel Torgashov for 'Fast Colored Textbox' and "Autocomplete Menu'.

For the best experience, it's better to run it on Windows 11 running Rectify11 (for full theming support, which includes built-in accent colorization and built-in light/dark mode).

## Compatibility
Works on **Windows 2000 or newer**, and you must have .NET Framework 2.0 installed. Thanks to the theme-aware focused development, no matter what theme you use, the app will automatically adapt to the style of the Windows you're running (as seen here in this screenshot).

Check the wiki for more notes about compatibility.

It's mandatory to have .NET Framework 1.1 and 2.0 installed.
