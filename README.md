Logix is a simple and easy to use Prolog/LISP/etc. text editor with syntax highlighting and many other features.

# Current version
Current version of Logix is **Testfire**. This version aims at having all the basic features done and implementing only Prolog syntax highlighting.

 # Development notes and credits
 This project has been built using Visual Studio 2005, built against .NET Framework 2.0. Credits to Pavel Torgashov for 'Fast Colored Textbox' and "Autocomplete Menu'.

For the best experience, it's better to run it on Windows 11 running Rectify11 (for full theming support, which includes built-in accent colorization and built-in light/dark mode).

## Compatibility
Theoretically, it should be able to run on Windows XP SP2/3 or newer. Currently, it has been tested only on 10/11, and it works. Thanks to the theme-aware focused development, no matter what theme you use, the app will automatically adapt to the style of the Windows you're running (as seen here in this screenshot).

It's mandatory to have .NET Framework 1.1 and 2.0 installed.
