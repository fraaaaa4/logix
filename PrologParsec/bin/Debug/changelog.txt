November 28th Version
- Gramlex: now you need to only point to the jar of jflex rather than its bat file.
- new help for Gramlex, will be moved (probably) in a later version to the HTML help.
- on the Fluent theme you have the option to make your toolbar icons coloured

November 26th Version
- now based on what you've written, selected, the toolbar buttons that didn't do anything get disabled anyway. E.g. if you don't have anything selected, cut and copy is disabled
- finished implementing C as syntax

November 25th Version
- emacs theme now available. Bear in mind that it disables lots of Logix features, in favor of the cumbersome, way too old, not user friendly, way too complex and way too disorganised interface of emacs. It mimicks the useless toolbar, the overly engineered menus, and the useless double status bar.
- improved titlebar look - now the text changes according to the tab you've opened
- added C\C++ syntax highlighting and code folding
- added basic object browser for C - need to disable it on other syntaxes, and finish implementing C.

November 22nd Version
- finished the entire coding refactoring of MDIParent1.cs at 1pm! Next up is Settings.cs
- fixed a few bugs here and there: checkboxes not working correctly, stuff not displaying properly, methods repeating themselves, methods declarated and then left there, etc etc now it only uses 13% CPU/35MB on start page, and 1% CPU/34MB on any other file.

November 21st Version
- added new custom headers and footers for each syntax - choose a different one for each one of those, or choose a custom one for each one of them
- Gramlex: now it automatically opens the cmd for you, and you can just paste in and you can run the program directly.
- Gramlex: you have now a button to open a new cmd window if you need about it.
- fixed an issue in the toolbar where you could make the buttons as big as you wished
- Gramlex: now there's a new button in Logix which can automatically send the file you've chosen directly to Gramlex, and automatically sorts out if it's a lexer or a parser
- new popups for saving and adding a thing to Gramlex for better visibility - can be turned off in favor of just using the status bar too.
- code refactoring: cleaned up lots of methods, unused variables, unused methods, etc. should now run slightly faster and occupy slightly less.
- new toolbar code: now the View Toolbar option works, works correctly with all the icon packs, and the icon change itself should now be easier to maintain, and now works correctly

- fixed a few grouping issues
- added a warning sign in pages that are empty, thanks Jevil
- added Luna icons to work on XP
- added a new OS X Panther look with Office X icons and a new toolbar background

November 18th Version
- fixed tooltips, now they do work
- when closing all your tabs, you can choose to close Logix

- changed Settings window frame to be sizable instead of FixedDialog
- line number control, toolbar and menu bar now have Mica effect on 11 (require MFE to be installed)
- navigate backward and forward now works between tabs

- added basic tooltip support: need to do an entire dictionary for everything that is in there, for prolog and all the others.

November 12th Version
- introduced Gramlex, the new GUI interface for ByaccJ and JFlex, both integrated into one app. The options for jflex and byaccj aren't made yet, but it can already generate everything up until even javac, all with one click. Remember that your byacc executable must be called byaccj.exe in order to work. Next update I'll fix this.
- thanks to @Splitwirez, changed the method to verify your version in all Logix to Ntdll.RtlGetVersion(). Much easier to use, much more reliable, much less prone to errors, and can detect if you're running Windows 10/11/any other NT version.
- fixed the Apply button in Animations settings.
- implemented only MonoSpace fonts in the font dialog, since the control couldn't load the others anyway.

- introduced few fixes for Yacc syntax
- moved the tabs to a splitcontainerpanel so the Document Map is now resizable yet again
- Show/hide rows now implemented
- when moving a panel, it now shows you the moving cursor
- Text properties are added! These are very specific settings relative to your current opened document, such as brackets completion, tab length, read only, word wrap mode, etc... it's a panel which shows on the right side of the window and can be easily toggled from the Format menu (will be movable in the future, for now that feature doesn't work)
- when deselecting everything in Startup it would show just an empty window; now it shows the "No file opened" dialog
- fixed an annoying resize bug at startup for the changelog widget

- Windows-aware icons: now if you're running 2000, the new Classic toolbar gets enabled; if you're running XP/Vista/7/8 the new Aero toolbar gets enabled; if you're running 10 or 11, the normal Fluent toolbar is enabled instead. This affects also all the icons in the nothing opened yet and start page. You can now force change them from Settings (temporary)
