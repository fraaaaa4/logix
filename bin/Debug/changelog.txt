November 9th Version
- started a basic implementation of JFlex and ByaccJ - will have GUI-based frameworks too

November 8th Version
- fixed extensions
- little change: now when creating a new tab or changing it, it automatically focuses to the textbox. 
- when changing tab, creating a new tab or opening it, now it enables you anyway the controls that might work, and re-enables the rest correctly
- introduced few fixes for Yacc syntax
- moved the tabs to a splitcontainerpanel so the Document Map is now resizable yet again
- Show/hide rows now implemented
- when moving a panel, it now shows you the moving cursor
- Text properties are added! These are very specific settings relative to your current opened document, such as brackets completion, tab length, read only, word wrap mode, etc... it's a panel which shows on the right side of the window and can be easily toggled from the Format menu (will be movable in the future, for now that feature doesn't work)
- when deselecting everything in Startup it would show just an empty window; now it shows the "No file opened" dialog
- fixed an annoying resize bug at startup for the changelog widget
